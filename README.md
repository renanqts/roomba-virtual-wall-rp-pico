# Roomba Virtual Wall with Raspberry Pico
This is the implementation of the Roomba Virtual Wall on Raspberry Pico using Micropython.   
That was properly tested in my Roomba 690.

## Requirements
- Micropython
- Raspberry Pico
- IR Transmitter   
  In my case, I used the one below, but it should work with others out of the box.
